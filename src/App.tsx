          </ul>
          Competency: Mid-level for front-end. Has strong foundation in both
          front-end & back-end.

          Skills: ReactJS, Ant Design, Material UI, MobX, Redux, TypeScript,
          JavaScript & other related front-end technologies.

          ~<br />
          <br />
          Supplementary note: I affirm my HackerRank scores reflect my abilities
          and were achieved without resorting to any form of cheating or
          unethical practices.
