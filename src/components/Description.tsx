        Supplementary note:
        <ul>
          <li>
            I left Accenture in June of 2025 for my career sabbatical and to
            focus on improving my technical expertise through performing
            LeetCode full-time.
          </li>
          <li>
            I affirm my HackerRank scores reflect my abilities and were achieved
            without resorting to any form of cheating or unethical practices.
          </li>
        </ul>
