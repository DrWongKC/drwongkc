        While Britta and Adele offered genuine recommendations, I couldn't
        resist playfully including one from my other half, who should know me
        best, right? ðŸ˜„ (recommendations updated: 27th March 2025)

              Kai is a fast learner and makes sure that he understands what he
              is trying to learn. He takes the time to reflect and makes sure he
              fully understands what he puts his focus into. He takes his
              learning at heart and not just for the sake of doing. He seeks out
              feedback and advice from his team and seniors on best practices to
              continually improve his work. He has well demonstrated his
              eagerness to learn and practically apply it at work that resulted
              with tasks delivered in a timely manner. He is very transparent
              and he never hesitates to seek help when needed and call out any
              possible delay or blockers ahead resulting in tasks and
              deliverables met accordingly and time-efficient. Keep up the good
              work and curiosity in whatever you do. Your hard work and
              dedication is deeply appreciated and will take you far in your
              career. Thank you and keep up the good work!

            <p>
              I worked collaboratively with Kai to develop KAI Studio, a game
              development startup. He communicates effectively in a timely,
              responsive manner. Kai did a great job bringing people on board
              and delegating tasks. We had some team members who did not live
              locally. He ensured that everyone was on the track and was making
              a contribution in the team. I look forward to working with Kai
              again in the future.
